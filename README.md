# VULD: A Launcher for Vanilla Mods

## Compilation

Compiled with [DJGPP](http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/).

Unzip the sources and run:

`make vuld`

## Runtime Prerequisites

* VULD
* [CWSDPMI](http://sandmann.dotster.com/cwsdpmi/)
* DEHACKED.EXE
* DEUSF.EXE or DEUTEX.EXE

## Instructions

* Gather the required ingredients below and put them in your game folder.
* Unzip the vanilla mods with flats, sprites, etc. and/or DeHackEd files into subdirectories of your main game folder.
* While in your main game folder, type `VRUN`, press enter, select the mod you want to play and it should compile and launch without modifying your game files.
    * **Warning:** If you have a doomhack.exe, back it up first or it will be overwritten!
    * If DeHackEd asks if you want to create a **doomhack.exe**, say "yes" to avoid overwriting data in your main game files.
